How to use the simulator in the gcloud_support_vm

upload the support bundle to your gcloud_support_vm.
Extract the zip file and access the support bundle directory
Use the command below to create the kubernetes context to access the support bundle content. This command might take a few minutes to complete.

support-bundle-kit simulator

The file with the context information is stored in the $home/.sim directory. Once the previous command finishes you can:

export KUBECONFIG=~/.sim/admin.kubeconfig

Create secrets for clusterissuer

cd /home/dmurga/.sim/ca
kubectl create secret tls self-signed-default-cert -n cert-manager --cert ca-cert.pem --key ca-key.pem

Now you can use kubectl commands to check the customer environment.
